1)Instead of sampling a big amount of lines that throw errors
in the frequencies (the 8.0gb error), get multiple samples with replacement (bootstraping i think)
and then average or sum the final frequency dfs. that way you will get
a better idea of the amounts.

2)Maybe use both removeSparse and freqTerms to account for both documents and plaing frequency
